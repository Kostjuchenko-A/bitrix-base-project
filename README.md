# Bitrix Base Project

This is an example of how I implement Bitrix apps in terms of structure and DevOps things.

### Run

To run the project like this one, you need to exec one command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate 
```

All documentation will split into following directions:

* [Project structure](./docs/project-structure.md)
* [Server configuration](./docs/server-software.md)
* [Back-end development](./docs/back-end-development.md)
* [Front-end development](./docs/front-end-development.md)
